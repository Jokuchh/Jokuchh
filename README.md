# About myself
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Jokuchh, 19y.o student of different universities with rich baggage of knowledge. For example during 2022 I was taking part in the Robotech project, for the Coupe de France Robotique ü§ñ I‚Äôm interested in different fields of IT such as : Automatisation, AI and Neural Networks, Crypto and blockchain technology. Still fine with Networks and Cybersecurity.
üå± I‚Äôm currently learning how to deal with AI and working on various researches üëÄ  


‚ú® Determined and self-confident, easy to accept criticism and ready for new discoveries. Adore team building and communication with people. 
üì´ How to reach me - first of all linkedin is connected as well as Twitter, but basically i prefer Instagram so you can reach me by @_diman.s.
üíÄ **All of them are private just to make sure that originality was maintained. In Contents you can find all of my projects and works which was done during 2020-2022 years, if you are interested more i can open all or some of the repositories for you.**

# Description of projects
Going to the **Repositories** you can see practical knowledge on such things as **C, C#, C++, Python, Jupyter notebook IDE, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java (I worked with it in my last job), SCSS practice, and various research**. 

Going to the **Repositories** -> **Certificates**  , you can see various **soft and hard skill certificates**. 



**Projects :** *Details in Content* 
- 1Ô∏è‚É£**Charity NFT project** ‚Äì Developed web-page, explored smart contract, led the team during whole process.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£**Six different researches about these robots** :
1. 3pi+ : Line tracking control strategies for mobile robots.
2. Qcar : Obstacle Detection and avoidance.
3. Qbot : Vision guided control for a differential drive mobile robot.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£**Robotech project** ‚Äì Creation of two collaborative robots that continuously inform each other of the progress of the missions thanks to robust wireless communications. If a robot encounters a problem, its co-robot is automatically informed so that the strategy is reviewed dynamically, making the robot "flotilla" fully autonomous. Creating arms for these robots - a concept and implementation of it.
- 4Ô∏è‚É£**AI & Machine Learning & Deep Learning & Reinforcment Learning** - a lot of different practice knowledge in these spheres. Details in the relevant topics. 
- 5Ô∏è‚É£**Internet of things** : 

 1. Study and development of a temperature monitoring platform : Creation of an IoT-based tool for live temperature monitoring using the ESP32 microcontroller and Cloud Computing.

 2. Contactless communication by using RFID and NFC technologies : Development of a contactless payment device using RFID with database (MySql). Main aim of which is to scan and store data, eventually to raise a discount. 
- 6Ô∏è‚É£**Various researches** - For now : 
1. Sensitivity-Analysis 
2. Digital-Signal-Processing
3. Digital-Image-Processing 
4. Cybersecurity
5. Numerical-Automatics
6. Software Engineering (Scrum, UML, Design Patterns)
7. Event control and multi agent system 
- 7Ô∏è‚É£**Esp32 project**  ‚Äì From esp32 to esp32 connection with rescaling voltage and converting from signal analogue to signal numerique.
- 8Ô∏è‚É£**WebDev projects** ‚Äì Developed web-sites, internet shops and e-platforms.
- 9Ô∏è‚É£**AppDev projects** ‚Äì Created a music player with key basic functionality.
- 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£**GameDev projects** ‚Äì Created a plot and basic functionality of a games, developed a design, technical and basic functionality of a 2D game.
- 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£**Digital Signal Processing & Digital Image Processing** - practice with image processing and exploring big part of digital signal processing.
- 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£**Pactice with core technologies for web pages** : WorkTimer, Clock, WhiteMouse, QR-Generator, Calculator-JS, LetITSnow, Record-Player.
