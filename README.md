👋 Hi, I’m @Jokuchh, 19y.o student of different universities with rich baggage of knowledge.
👀 I’m interested in different fields of IT such as : Automatisation, AI and Neural Networks, Crypto and blockchain technology. Still fine with Networks and Cybersecurity. 
🌱 I’m currently learning how to deal with AI and taking part in the Robotech project.  
✨ Determined and self-confident, easy to accept criticism and ready for new discoveries. Adore team building and communication with people. 
📫 How to reach me - first of all linkedin is connected as well as Twitter, but basically i prefer Instagram so you can reach me by @_diman.s.

**Projects :** 
- 1️⃣**Charity NFT project** – Developed web-page, explored smart contract, led the team during whole process.
- 2️⃣**Six different researches about these robots** :
1. 3pi+ : Line tracking control strategies for mobile robots.
2. Qcar : Obstacle Detection and avoidance.
3. Qbot : Vision guided control for a differential drive mobile robot.
- 3️⃣**Robotech project** – Creation of two collaborative robots that continuously inform each other of the progress of the missions thanks to robust wireless communications. If a robot encounters a problem, its co-robot is automatically informed so that the strategy is reviewed dynamically, making the robot "flotilla" fully autonomous. Creating arms for these robots - a concept and implementation of it.
- 4️⃣**AI & Machine Learning & Deep Learning** - a lot of different prectice knowledge in these spheres
- 5️⃣**Internet of things** : 

 1. Study and development of a temperature monitoring platform : Creation of an IoT-based tool for live temperature monitoring using the ESP32 microcontroller and Cloud Computing.

 2. Contactless communication by using RFID and NFC technologies : Development of a contactless payment device using RFID with database (MySql). Main aim of which is to scan and store data, eventually to raise a discount. 
- 6️⃣**Various researches** - For now Numerical-Automatics & Sensitivity-Analysis
- 7️⃣**Esp32 project**  – From esp32 to esp32 connection with rescaling voltage and converting from signal analogue to signal numerique.
- 8️⃣**WebDev projects** – Developed web-sites, internet shops and e-platforms.
- 9️⃣**AppDev projects** – Created a music player with key basic functionality.
- 1️⃣0️⃣**GameDev projects** – Created a plot and basic functionality of a games, developed a design, technical and basic functionality of a 2D game.
