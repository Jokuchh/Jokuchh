# About myself 
👋🏽 Hi, I’m @Jokuchh, a 19y.o student of different universities with a rich baggage of knowledge. For example, in 2022 I was taking part in the Robotech project, for the Coupe de France Robotique 🤖 I’m interested in different fields of IT such as QA Testing, Automatisation, IoT, Artificial intelligence & Data Science, Crypto & blockchain technology. I with such things as scrum and various other agile methods. Still fine with Networks and Cybersecurity.
🌱 I’m currently learning how to deal with AI and working on various research, practicing with testing web/games/mobile apps 👀  


✨ Determined and self-confident, easy to accept criticism, and ready for discoveries. Adore team building and communication with people. I have commercial experience as a Team Lead, Junior software QA and engineer, which is described in detail in my LinkedIn and my CV. 📫 How to reach me - first of all LinkedIn is connected as well to Twitter, but I prefer Instagram so you can reach me by @_diman.s.🪐

# Description of projects
Going to the **Repositories** you can see practical knowledge on such things as **C, C#, C++, Python, Jupyter notebook IDE, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java (I worked with it in my last job), SCSS practice, and various research**. 

Going to the **Repositories** -> **Certificates**  , you can see various **soft and hard skill certificates**. 



**Projects :** *Details in Content* 
- 1️⃣**Charity NFT project** – Developed web-page, explored smart contract, led the team during whole process.
- 2️⃣**Six different researches about these robots** :
1. 3pi+ : Line tracking control strategies for mobile robots.
2. Qcar : Obstacle Detection and avoidance.
3. Qbot : Vision guided control for a differential drive mobile robot.
- 3️⃣**Robotech project** – Creation of two collaborative robots that continuously inform each other of the progress of the missions thanks to robust wireless communications. If a robot encounters a problem, its co-robot is automatically informed so that the strategy is reviewed dynamically, making the robot "flotilla" fully autonomous. Creating arms for these robots - a concept and implementation of it.
- 4️⃣**AI & Machine Learning & Deep Learning & Reinforcment Learning** - a lot of different practice knowledge in these spheres. Details in the relevant topics. 
- 5️⃣**Internet of things** : 

 1. Study and development of a temperature monitoring platform : Creation of an IoT-based tool for live temperature monitoring using the ESP32 microcontroller and Cloud Computing.

 2. Contactless communication by using RFID and NFC technologies : Development of a contactless payment device using RFID with database (MySql). Main aim of which is to scan and store data, eventually to raise a discount. 
- 6️⃣**Various researches** - For now :
