Creating arms for these robots - a concept and implementation of it.
- 6️⃣**Esp32 project**  – From esp32 to esp32 connection with rescaling voltage and converting from signal analogue to signal numerique.
- 7️⃣**Internet of things** : 

 1. Study and development of a temperature monitoring platform : Creation of an IoT-based tool for live temperature monitoring using the ESP32 microcontroller and Cloud Computing.

 2. Contactless communication by using RFID and NFC technologies : Development of a contactless payment device using RFID with database (MySql). Main aim of which is to scan and store data, eventually to raise a discount.
